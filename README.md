# MDtool
MDtool is a console application for configuring and performing basic diagnostics on MD80-based drives via CANdle. For more information please refer to [MD80 x CANdle Manual](https://www.mabrobotics.pl/servos/#comp-l6v4io99).

# Installing
The easiest way to install the MDtool is to select the appropriate *.deb package from the MDtool GitHub repo 'Releases' page. To install after the download simply call:
```sudo apt install ./mdtool_xx-x_xx.deb```
After the install please make sure the current user is added to the dialout group using the command: 
```sudo adduser <current user> dialout```
if it wasn't, please reboot the PC:
```sudo reboot```
It is also recommended to install the setserial package which allows for higher communication speeds:
```sudo apt install setserial```

# Building
If for some reason you'd like to build mdtool from source:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
for native architecture, or 

```
./release.sh
```
if you want to build for all architectures at once
